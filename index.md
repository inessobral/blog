# Welcome To The Brave World Of Work 



Hi you all. Be very welcome to The Brave World of Work, a personal blog on the challenging aspects of work nowadays. 

With the surge of AI, automation and remote work in the last few years, we are now on the brink of a technological revolution that is undeniably changing the way we work, communicate, and even relate to each other.

I hope together we can use this space for an ongoing strategic dialogue ultimately aimed at making the future of work a much better world that works for everyone.
